/**
 * ConceptLensMapComponent — the A+ "My Knowledge" graph fisheye LENS
 * (owner-approved 2026-07-03; supersedes the 6-neighbour hex on this surface).
 *
 * Presentational: it renders the WHOLE map's concepts on one bounded SVG canvas
 * and emits interaction intents; the parent page owns all data + service calls.
 * A lens magnifies the focus + its neighbourhood while the periphery shrinks but
 * never vanishes — local realistic context AND the grand picture in fixed bounds,
 * NO pan/zoom (focus+context / DOI-tree principle: "nodes translate, never
 * disappear"). Theme = "Indigo Monochrome": paper-white rounded hexes, one indigo
 * for the focus, a pale-indigo root tint, neutral-grey shadows (softer under the
 * focus so it lifts), wrapped labels, no rim.
 *
 * - tap / Enter / Space on any node → `select(conceptId)` (parent focuses + opens
 *   its detail); the lens eases onto it (rAF; honours prefers-reduced-motion).
 * - "make this my root" → `makeRoot` (operates on the current focus).
 * - `settled` fires when the re-focus resolves (parent redraws the connector).
 *
 * The geometry is the pure, unit-tested `./concept-lens` module. Per chora-web
 * CLAUDE.md §3 — standalone, signal state, OnPush.
