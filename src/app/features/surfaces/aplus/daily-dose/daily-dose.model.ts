 *
 * `DailyDose` is the canonical Chora primitive for daily micro-learning
 * (per `domain-vocabulary` skill — never "daily quiz"). Each dose is
 * composed of N atoms ordered by Ebbinghaus retention urgency (low → medium →
 * high → unknown) by the chora-consumption Ebbinghaus Scheduler crew:
 *   - 'review'  → retention_state=low  (40% — Ebbinghaus overdue)
 *   - 'stretch' → retention_state=medium (30% — weakness/spaced-rep lag)
 *   - 'new'     → retention_state=unknown (30% — no history yet)
 *
 * WS-12-SR-2 (follow-up BE ask): `retention_state` is not yet in the atom
 * wire. Derived from `category` via `retentionStateFromCategory()` in
 * `spaced-repetition.service.ts` until BE adds it.
 *
 * WS-12-NUDGE (follow-up BE ask): per-Familiar recommended-atoms endpoint
 * (`GET /api/v1/familiars/{id}/recommended-atoms`) is NOT in bff-gateway.yaml
 * as of 2026-05-26. Familiar nudge is surfaced via `familiar_nudge` field
 * on the DailyDose response once BE ships this endpoint.
 *
 * The composition signal is emitted on `chora.consumption.daily_dose.served.v1`
 * per `pub-sub-topology` skill. This surface only reads its projection.
