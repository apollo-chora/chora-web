/**
 * CampaignPracticeService — the WS-C7 (CHO-2086) hex-tap practice lane adapter.
 *
 * Two doors against chora-consumption's campaign question lane (ADR-227 D13),
 * both nested under the already-proxied `/api/v1/me/goals/{goalId}` subtree:
 *
 *   load(goalId, conceptId)  GET  …/campaign/questions?concept_id={conceptId}
 *   answer(goalId, req)      POST …/campaign/questions/answer
 *
 * The GET reuses the "generate once, retrieve forever" question bank: a servable
 * set returns `status: ready` + the qgen `BatchCandidatePayload` verbatim; a
 * miss / in-flight / failed set returns a poll status the component re-polls.
 *
 * Grading is SERVER-side ONLY (contract §3). The §2 serve is SANITISED
 * pre-grade (Slice F) — no answer key AND no per-option explainer (it is
 * answer-revealing). `parseCampaignQuestions` normalises only the learner-safe
 * fields (stem + option id/text). The verdict, the correct option
 * (`correct_option_id`) and the explainer all arrive on the §3 POST response.
 *
 * Per chora-web CLAUDE.md §3 all HTTP goes through BffClientService; per
 * `reusable-fe-error-detail-apierror-body-not-error` every failure is read via
 * `httpErrorView` (ApiError.body, NOT err.error) and re-thrown as a typed
 * CampaignPracticeError carrying the BE's `{code, message}` envelope.

// The `questions` field of a `ready` serve is the qgen crew's
// `candidate_payload_json` — but the §2 serve is SANITISED pre-grade (BE Slice
// F): the answer key (`is_correct`) AND the per-option `explainer` (which is
// answer-revealing) are stripped. So a served option carries only its stable
// `option_id` + display `text`/`label`. The correct option + explainer arrive
// on the §3 ANSWER response, post-grade (`CampaignAnswerResult.correct_option_id`
// + `.explainer`). We model the served shape honestly (no answer-key fields) and
// compute the A/B/C/D marker locally (mcq-option-naming).
